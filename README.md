# Gold Mine Community Door Server

The [Github Pages Site](https://robbiew.github.io/goldmine/) contains instructions on how to join, setup as well as direct door codes if you want ot bypass the Gold Mine main menu.

This repo contains scripts for Alpha Complex BBS. Unless you are planning on running a Game Server on a Talisman BBS, this repo is probably not for you.
