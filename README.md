# Gold Mine Community Door Server

Gold Mine (named after a mall-based, [coin-op arcade chain](https://arcadepreservation.fandom.com/wiki/Gold_Mine) near where aLPHA grew up) is a Community Door Server for BBS-based games. Open to all, easy to access.

GoldMine runs on Synchronet (Linux 64) on port 513 at 165.232.153.209.

BBS SysOps can easily join by visiting alphacomplex.us:2323 (with a terminal program like SyncTerm or MagiTerm) and hit [J] JOIN GOLDMINE from the main menu. Just fill out the form, and your BBS IP address will be queued for white-listing on the firewall, so you can connect on port 513 via RLOGIN. 

Setup an outbound RLOGIN connection from a menu item on your BBS (instructions are on Alpha Complex). 

That's it!  

You can view the [game list here](https://robbiew.github.io/goldmine/), as well as the direct door codes if you want ot bypass the GoldMine menu.
